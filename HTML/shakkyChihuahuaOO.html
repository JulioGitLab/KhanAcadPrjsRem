<!-- SHAKKY CHIHUAHUA!

   Game project of a little Chihuahua dog looking for its toys.

   Grab at least 30 toys while avoiding the chanclas and the cat!
   - If Shakky finds a chancla it will get distracted and drop a toy.
   - If Meowwy the cat catches Shakky they will fight making you lose several toys (and most likely the game).
   - There will be at least 30 toys and up to 10 chanclas, but there could be a couple more toys. So
     don't give up if you miss a toy or two, as you still have a chance of completing the challenge.
