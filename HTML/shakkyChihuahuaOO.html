<!-- SHAKKY CHIHUAHUA!

   Game project of a little Chihuahua dog looking for its toys.

   Grab at least 30 toys and avoid the chanclas and the cat!
   - If Shakky finds a chancla it will get distracted and drop
   a toy. There will be at least 30 toys and up to 10 chanclas,
   but there could be a couple more toys. So don't give up if
   you miss a toy or two at the beginning, as you still have a
   chance of completing the challenge.
   - If Meowwy the cat catches Shakky they will fight and you
   lose several toys (and most likely the game).
