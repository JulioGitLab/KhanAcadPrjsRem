<!-- Project of the classic "tic-tac-toe" game, also known as "noughts and crosses" and "Xs and Os".
   
   Two players take turns marking the spaces in the three by three grid with X or O.
   The first player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
   
   This project uses the p5.js library. -->
